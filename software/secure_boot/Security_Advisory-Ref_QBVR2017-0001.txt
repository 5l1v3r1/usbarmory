Security advisory: High Assurance Boot (HABv4) bypass
=====================================================

The NXP i.MX53 System-on-Chip, main processor used in the USB armory Mk I board
[1] design, suffers from vulnerabilities that allow bypass of the optional High
Assurance Boot function (HABv4).

The HABv4 [2] enables on-chip internal boot ROM authentication of the initial
bootloader with a digital signature, establishing the first trust anchor for
further code authentication.

This functionality is commonly known as Secure Boot [3] and it can be activated
by users who require authentication of the bootloader (e.g. U-Boot) to further
maintain, and verify, trust of executed code.

Quarkslab reported [4] to NXP, and subsequently to Inverse Path, two different
techniques for bypassing HABv4 by means of exploiting validation errors in the
SoC internal boot ROM [5], which are exposed before bootloader authentication
takes place.

While the two vulnerabilities have been initially reported for the i.MX6 SoC,
Inverse Path evaluated that both issues also apply to the i.MX53 SoC, used on
the USB armory Mk I.

The HABv4 feature is not enabled by default on the USB armory Mk I and does not
impact its normal operation. This advisory concerns only users that follow, and
rely upon, the Secure Boot [3] procedure. See Impact section for a detailed
analysis.

Finding #1 (ERR010873)
======================

Technical details under embargo until July 18th, by mutual agreement between
reported and NXP.

Finding #2 (ERR010872)
======================

Technical details under embargo until July 18th, by mutual agreement between
reported and NXP.

Impact
======

The HABv4 feature is not enabled by default on the USB armory Mk I and does not
impact its normal operation.

The Secure Boot [3] procedure is supported for specific use cases where
authentication of the initial bootloader is required to further maintain a
chain of trust.

This scenario does not typically apply to Linux distributions, such as the USB
armory Mk I default Debian image, as the chain of trust is typically lost
between the kernel and userspace (and therefore tampering is always possible,
regardless of Secure Boot).

For environments with a complete chain of trust (e.g. embedded kernel ramdisk
images) Secure Boot allows the first hardware anchor.

The USB armory impact is evaluated with the following considerations:

* The USB armory is an unconventional embedded device that promotes, through
  its custom form factor, defensive uses where the device is never left
  unattended and therefore preventing "Evil Maid" kind of attacks.

  Also it should be emphasized that Secure Boot protects the hardware from
  unauthenticated code, and not the other way around. Signed microSD cards can
  always be executed on any USB armory board without HABv4 enabled.

  For these reason the importance of Secure Boot, most valuable on unattended
  hardware, is marginal unless physical tampering or replacement of a valid
  microSD card is considered a potential threat.

* The NXP Security Controller (SCCv2) Linux driver [7] allows AES encryption
  using the USB armory Mk I SoC internal key. The key cannot be read, but only
  used by means of the SCCv2, additionally the key is only activated when HABv4
  is enabled.

  The SCCv2 therefore allows device specific AES encryption/decryption and,
  while the secret key is only activated when HABv4 secure state is assured,
  compromise of the HABv4 does not constitute a key leak as it remains
  unreadable to the CPU.

  For this reason the SCCv2 functionality remains effective in terms of
  restricting AES encryption/decryption to a specific device with its own
  secret key.

  Additionally the SCCv2 use cases promoted by Inverse Path, for the USB
  armory, always consist of two-factor encryption. For instance the INTERLOCK
  [8] encryption front-end allows optional support for the SCCv2 to derive
  device specific keys always in combination with user provided passphrases.

* The vulnerability remains critical for unattended setups that rely on the
  combination of Secure Boot and SCCv2 to protect cryptographic secrets,
  that are meant to be used without any user input (or network based
  challenge/response validation of the SCCv2 secret key).

  An example of such setup would be unattended deployments, without network
  connectivity, such as licensing tokens.

Affected P/Ns
=============

The reported [4] vulnerabilities affect High Assurance Boot version 4 (HABv4)
present on multiple Freescale/NXP i.MX family of application processors.

The i.MX53 family of processors, mounted on all USB armory Mk I boards, is
affected by the two reported vulnerabilities.

Given that the internal boot ROM cannot be updated, only a new silicon revision
by NXP, with an adequately patched boot ROM, can address the vulnerabilities.

NXP has yet to provide publicly available part numbers addressing reported
vulnerabilities as it has informed us that, at this time, more information can
only be provided by NXP to their customers under NDA.

If and when NXP will release a new i.MX53 silicon revision, addressing the
findings, Inverse Path plans to evaluate sourcing of updated components for a
new production batch of the USB armory Mk I board.

Contact
=======

Inverse Path has been working with the few customers that employ affected use
cases to successfully implement mitigations.

Any customer relying on Secure Boot on the USB armory product is welcome to
contact <support@inversepath.com> for assistance in evaluating the potential
impact and applicable mitigations.
